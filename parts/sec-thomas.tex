The expression of fixed points in a given regulatory network is potentially one of the most crucial behaviors to include in a model and is often the 
aspect of greatest interest for a biologist. For this reason, a great amount of research has gone toward the topic of fixed point analysis. We have 
already mentioned that a positive circuit is a proven necessary condition for multiple fixed points, as shown in~\cite{Richard2010378}, but this does 
not speak to the exact number of fixed points present in the system. In the field of Boolean networks, analysis of the interaction graph can give an 
upper bound of the possible number of fixed points~\cite{aracena2008maximum} and the topological fixed points independent of logical 
functions~\cite{PR10-CRAS}, but these still do not give a complete enumeration.
In \cite{Naldi07}, the authors propose an efficient method for enumerating all the fixed point by relying on the
encoding of logical functions using decision diagrams.
